    "text": "Methodology\nIn collaboration with Who Targets Me, we monitored 7337 political advertisers to better understand how campaigns use different targeting methods made available by Meta. To do this, we used data from the Meta Ad Library, using the new â€˜Audienceâ€™ data which gives some detail on how pages target their ads.\nTo better understand the election, we kept only advertisers who:\n\nAdvertised in the last 7 days (5 Mar - 11 Mar 2024)\nAdvertised in the last 30 days (11 Feb - 11 Mar 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMeta only provides 7, 30 and 90 days windows for the targeting data in their Ad Library. Metaâ€™s data also lags by a few days. Report will be updated as soon as new data is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\nThe data shown in this dashboard is based on the platformâ€™s respective ad libraries which are known to be sometimes incomplete (Edelson et al.Â 2020; Silva et al.Â 2020). For this reason the data shown here might not reflect the full picture nor all political ads that were targeted at voters.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Creator of the Dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabio Votta is a Postdoc at the University of Amsterdam who studies (online) political microtargeting and its usage around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to see how political parties target you? Sign up at Who Targets Me and download the gratis browser plugin to see how parties on Facebook use your data:\nhttps://whotargets.me/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to retrieve targeting data from the Facebook Ad Library yourself? This dashboard is powered by the R package: metatargetr.
